## Docker Setup for n8n

You'll first need to install Docker from [Docker.com](https://www.docker.com/).

You'll also need to sign up for a free account with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

Update the ngrok token in your `docker-compose.yml`.

Once that's installed and running on your computer, from the terminal (Windows) or command line (Mac), navigate to the root of this repository.

From the root of this repository, run the following command:

    docker-compose up

In a little while, you should see an output that says:

    Editor is now accessible via:
    http://localhost:5678/

Visit that link in your browser to sign in.

You can look into the n8n docs for further details: https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/docker/
